What is simulated annealing?,"A simulated annealing combines hill climbing with a random walk in a way that yields both efficiency and completeness.
"
What is annealing?,"""Annealing is the process used to temper or harden metals and glass by heating them to a high temperature and then gradually cooling them"
What is local beam search?,"The local beam search algorithm keeps track of k states rather than just one. 
"
How does the local beam search operate?,"""It begins with k randomly generated states. At each step"
What is evolutionary algoritms?,"Evolutionary algorithms can be seen as variants of stochastic beam search that are explicitly motivated by the metaphor of natural selection in biology.
"
What is genetic algorithm?,"""Genetic algorithms are similar to stochastic beam search"
When is the genetic algorithm advantageous?,"Genetic algorithm is advantageous when there are blocks that perform useful functions.
"
What are empirical gradient methods?,"Empirical gradient methods are methods that measure progress by the change in the value of the objective function between two nearby points
"
What is a belief state?," A belief state is a set of physical states that the agent believes are possible.
"
What is a sensorless problem?,"A sensorless problem is when the agent’s percepts provide no information at all.
"
What are offline search algorithms?,"Offline search algorithms compute a complete solution before taking their first action.
"
What are online search algorithms?,"""Online search algorithms take an action first"
How is an online search problem solved?,"""An online search problem is solved by interleaving computation"
What is competitive ratio?,"Competitive ratio is the comparison of the cost with the path cost the agent would incur if it knew the search space in advance.
"
What are dead ends?,"Dead ends are states from which no goal state is reachable.
"
What is the meaning of safely explorable?,"Safely explorable is when some goal state is reachable from every reachable state. 
"
What is random walk?,"A random walk simply selects at random one of the available actions from the current state
